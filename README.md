# Personal Webite

A small personal website built with React and Vite that doubles as a mini scavenger hunt. Visitors land on a playful profile page, discover hints, unlock a password screen, and eventually reach a hidden “secret” page.

## Tech stack

- React (SPA)
- React Router (`react-router-dom`)
- Vite
- CSS modules for styling (`App.css`, `Password.css`, `Secret.css`, `index.css`)

---

3. Start the dev server:
